主要讲解在centos 6.3下安装go
google code上面的安装go的版本比较老咯，信息有误。
安装完成后：
Go version is "go1.0.3", ignoring -next /usr/local/go/api/next.txt

ALL TESTS PASSED

---
Installed Go for linux/386 in /usr/local/go
Installed commands in /usr/local/go/bin
*** You need to add /usr/local/go/bin to your PATH.
参考文档：
https://golang.org/doc/install/source
export GOROOT=$HOME/go		//====/usr/local/go
export GOARCH=386
export GOOS=linux

The Go compilation environment can be customized by environment variables. None is required by the build, but you may wish to set some to override the defaults.

$GOROOT

The root of the Go tree, often $HOME/go. Its value is built into the tree when it is compiled, and defaults to the parent of the directory where all.bash was run. There is no need to set this unless you want to switch between multiple local copies of the repository.
